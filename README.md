# Practice-repo
First Github repository - just trying it out 

# New player
Hello there; wanted to write this text as a lil introductory script since this is my first Git post and I'm that type of person, My name is Kervens & I'm a Tad bit new to programming overall(about 2 months In), Not much background and I am currently starting off as a self taught programmer with python as my primary language. 

# Vision
My primary goal starting off as a rookie programmer is a bit bleak; I intially started off because I wanted to build an Algo trading program to Implement in my trading strategy and sort of "eat at as many pips" as I can, but then came the challenge of not knowing where to start (for me atleast) & having to start off @ the roots of coding to properly learn how build an algo, but along the line I got Interested in all the other (current) opportunities programming can bring & decided to dig deeper and not just think of coding @ a 2nd dimension money hungry level. Although I dont know what my future projects may be, I do plan to continue to broaden my understanding of programming & technology altogether & hopefully excel and shine @ the highest degree (No Debate).
